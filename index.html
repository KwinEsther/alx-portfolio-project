    <h1>Welcome to your daily habit tracker!</h1>

      <p>
        Building habits can be tough, I get it because I’ve been there too.
        Maybe you've tried using sticky notes, reminders, or even apps that felt
        too complicated or overwhelming.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why I created this <b>habit tracker.</b> It's a simple, effective
        way to help you stay consistent and make lasting changes in your life.
        Whether you're just starting out or trying to get back on track, this is
        your space to grow, one habit at a time.
